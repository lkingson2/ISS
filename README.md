## Installation

Clone this respository
```
npm i
```
```
npm start
```

### Summary

This application uses the http://api.open-notify.org/ to get the location of the Internation Space Station as well as the current astronauts in space.

I use a d3 map to visualize the current location of the ISS in real time. Next to that I provide a list of all the current astronauts at the ISS that when clicked on will redirect you to their wikipedia page. (Except for Anatoly Ivanishnin who's name is mispelled)


### Future Steps

I have a few ideas for ways to improve this application

- Let the user input  on the map to show when the ISS will be at that location.
- Scrape certain websites to give updates on future space missions.
